# Bikeshare Data Analysis â€“ Udacity Nanodegree Project

This project is part of the **Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree**.  
The goal is to explore US bikeshare data from three major cities â€” **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington** â€” and analyze usage patterns based on user input.

##  Project Objective
The Python script (`bikeshare.py`) runs in an interactive terminal. It allows users to:
- Select a city to analyze (Chicago, New York City, or Washington)
- Optionally filter the data by **month** (January to June) or **day of the week**
- View various statistics about:
  - Most frequent travel times
  - Most popular stations
  - Trip durations
  - User demographics (e.g., gender, birth year)

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook / Terminal** for execution

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Conditional logic and loops
- Handling user input and validation
- Basic statistical computations
- Reading CSV files and filtering DataFrames

## Data Sources
The data used in this project includes CSV files provided by Udacity:
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository, then execute the Python script in your terminal:

```bash
python bikeshare.py
